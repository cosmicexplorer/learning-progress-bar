#+TITLE: README
#+STARTUP: showall

/A project to guess how much time is left for a process to complete, based upon prior knowledge of its runs./

* Goals
1. Track stdout/stderr, and provide neat methods to stream it places.
   - Possibly have an API that allows for collating the streaming results from /multiple/ processes invoked this way?
   - /Make this part very fast too./
2. Provide a ~pv~-like progress bar, using unsupervised statistical inference to infer what's going to happen next and how long it's going to take.
3. ???
   - We could also consider interacting with other tracing systems like ~strace~ to bring to bear on our inference.
